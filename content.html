        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
        <p>
            cricket, England's national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world, particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan,
             the West Indies, and the British Isles.<br><br>
             Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular
              area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, 
              called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails.
            The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two 
            innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering
            the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that 
            the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player
             from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/hiscricket.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
        <p>
            There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the 
            Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England. The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport
             was in 1611, and in the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have 
             derived from bowls, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away.Village 
             cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century and the first English “county teams” were formed in the second half of the
              century, as “local experts” from village cricket were employed as the earliest professionals. The first known game in which the 
              teams use county names is in 1709
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the first half of the 18th Century cricket established itself as a leading sport in London and the south-eastern counties of 
            England. Its spread was limited by the constraints of travel, but it was slowly gaining popularity in other parts of England and
             Women’s Cricket dates back to the 1745, when the first known match was played in Surrey.In 1744, the first Laws of Cricket were 
             written and subsequently amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, a 3rd stump, - the middle stump and a maximum bat width 
             were added. The codes were drawn up by the “Star and Garter Club” whose members ultimately founded the famous Marylebone Cricket
            Club at Lord's in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made revisions ever since then to the current day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rolling the ball along the ground was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and in response to that
             innovation the straight bat replaced the old “hockey-stick” style of bat. The Hambledon Club in Hampshire was the focal point of 
             the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787.Cricket was introduced 
             to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century, and in the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the 
             globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by colonists and to India by British East India Company mariners. It arrived in 
             Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788 and the sport reached New Zealand and South Africa in the early years of 
             the 19th century.
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="Origin">Origin of Cricket</h2><br>
        <p>
            The game is believed to have started in South East England during the time of Saxons and/or Normans. In fact, it was a game played
             by children in the countryside. Little boys bowled into either a tree stump or a sheep pen gate. The crossbar on the gate was the
              bail, and the gate the wicket.When bowled into, the bail would get dislodged. This made it more preferable than a tree stump and 
              possibly explains the design of the modern day wicket. A shaped tree branch was used to hit the oncoming ball before it hits the 
              wicket.It's only during the 1700s that cricket started becoming more of an adult sport. Bowling techniques weren't as advanced 
              during these times and batting dominated the sport. This lead to early advancements in the design of bats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fun Fact: The existence of cricket was formally documented for the first time in a 1598 court case over a land dispute - the case 
            files mention a John Derrick having testified to playing creckett in the said land half a century before the case. This proves the 
            definite existence of cricket in the 1500s. With the British empire's expansion, soldiers and settlers brought the game with them 
            to the various colonies under their control. And thus began the story of cricket.
        </p><br><br>
        <h2 id="become-International">Cricket becomes an international sport</h2><br>
        <p>
          In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between what were essentially club teams, from the United States and Canada, 
          in Toronto; Canada won. In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour.Meanwhile, 
          the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well 
          established in Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North 
          America and South Africa.In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.The first Australian team to travel overseas 
          consisted of Aboriginal stockmen which toured England in 1868.

          <h2 id="20century">World cricket in the 20th century</h2><br>
          <p>
            The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batter of all time. Test cricket 
            continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before 
            the Second World War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland and Afghanistan 
            (both 2018) in the post-war period.South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid 
            boycott.

            As a very accessible sport, Cricket can be seen being played everywhere in the country. It is not uncommon to see children playing 
            with a plank of wood as a bat even. Stumps are almost always sticks placed upright between two rocks.Thanks to the popularity of 
            the sport, there is a huge demand for the gear used. The equipment can be found within everyone's budget range. There are universal 
            rules that apply to all formats that's regularly updated by the ICC and of course, gully cricket rules governed by the older players
            in your neighbourhood.As an established sport, cricket has its own exercises, drills and tips and techniques to bat, bowl and field 
            better. Cricket is also an easier way to keep fit and be in shape than cultivating a workout habit. However, with more land being 
            taken up for huge housing projects, the need for grounds to play in has increased drastically. This need has given rise to many 
            cricket facilities across the country, all bookable on Playo!

        <h2 id="rules">Rules of Cricket</h2><br>
        <img src="images/rules.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
        <p>
            Cricket is played by two teams of 11, with one side taking a turn to bat a ball and score runs, while the other team will bowl and 
            field the ball to restrict the opposition from scoring. The main objective in cricket is to score as many runs as possible against 
            the opponent. Before the match begins, the captain of both teams will toss a coin, with the winner of the toss being able to decide 
            which team bats and fields first.<br>

            Each cricket match consists of periods known as innings, and the number of innings that each team has will be determined before the 
            match, usually one or two. During an inning, one team bats the ball while the other attempts to field. Both teams take turns 
            alternating between batting and fielding.<br>


            The match takes place on an oval cricket field, which consists of a rectangular pitch in the center. A boundary marks the perimeter 
            of the field, and can take the form of a fence, ropes or lines. Additionally, a wooden target known as the wicket is placed on both 
            ends of the rectangular pitch, approximately 20 meters apart. The wicket is made out of three stumps, supporting two bails that sit 
            on the stumps.<br>


            Lines also mark the pitch, with a line called the bowling crease placed in line to the wicket. Another line, known as the popping 
            or batting crease, is located around 1.2 meters in front of the wicket. These creases determine the area in which the bowler and 
            batter can operate.<br>


            While the game is in progress, all 11 members of the fielding team have to be on the field, but only two members of the batting team
             are allowed to be on the playing ground. A player is selected from the fielding team and he is known as the bowler, while the rest 
             of the 10 players are known as fielders. The bowler will then attempt to hit the wicket with the ball, while one of the fielders south-east
              specifically known as the wicket keeper - crouches behind the wicket to catch the ball if it misses.The batsman from the 
              opposition team will attempt to hit the bowled ball before it hits the wicket. The rest of the fielders are required to chase the ball once the batsman has hit it. The role of the batsman is to prevent the wicket from getting hit by the ball, by batting the ball away. Additionally, in order to score a run, both batsman have to run from their respective wickets to the other as many times as possible after a ball has been hit.

            <h2>Batting</h2><br>
            <img src="images/batting.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
            <p>
                For some, batting is arguably the most exciting and important aspect of cricket. Apart from the impressive sight and sound of 
                the ball flying off the bat after a great stroke, it's one of the keys towards victory as good batting increases the number of 
                runs scored efficiently and prevents the loss of a team's wicket effectively.
                <br>
                During a cricket match, there can only be two batsmen on the playing ground at any one time, with one batsman in front of the 
                stumps at the striker's end, and the other standing at the non-striker's end where the bowler is. In general terms, each time a 
                team bats through the batting order, this is known as their innings.<br>
                While there are a variety of different techniques that a batsman can employ during a game, the most orthodox ones are variations 
                of the standard side-on stance. This stance sees the batsman being in a relaxed but balanced position, with feet typically around 
                40 centimetres apart. Both feet should also be parallel and on either sides of the batting crease, and the front shoulder should be 
                pointing downwards to the wicket. The batsman should also have his head facing the bowler.<br>

                Once this stance has been accomplished, the batsman needs to pay attention to the bowler. He should start lifting the bat up, 
                so that it is behind him, when the bowler is about to deliver the ball, so that the batsman will be able to move quickly once 
                the ball is on its path towards him. This is known as the 'backlift'.<br>

                Each batsman will choose different ways of hitting the ball, as there are dozens of different shots that can be employed, with 
                varying results. For instance, there are vertical bat strokes (drive, glance, defensive shot), horizontal bat strokes (cut, 
                sweep, square drive, pull and hook), as well as a variety of unorthodox strokes (reverse sweep, upper cut, helicopter shot, 
                scoop, switch hit, slog sweep).<br>

                Just as crucially, a batsman needs to be disciplined and 'leave' or let a delivery go if he deems it as being bowled wide or 
                away from the stumps. Indiscipline and a failure to judge wide balls can often lead to mistakes by batsmen who go chasing after 
                them, which could lead to unnecessary dismissals.<br>

                In one-day international cricket matches, batsmen tend to attempt to score as quickly as possible, due to the fact that there 
                is a limited number of overs to be played. This means that the batsman will try to score at least one run for every ball that 
                is bowled.<br>

                Unlike one-day international cricket, Test cricket games have unlimited number of overs, and thus the strategy for batting is 
                different as well. In Test cricket, the batsmen are not in a rush to score runs and the key here is to establish a good run-rate,
                 stay on the cricket pitch as long as possible and tire out the bowlers. As such a lot of defensive blocks while batting are used,
                 protecting their wicket to prevent being dismissed.<br>

                With that in mind, the starting batsman for one-day competitions compared to Test matches are chosen with different sets of 
                criteria. For one-dayers, the first few batsman are usually the biggest and strongest hitters as they are able to score more 
                runs. However, in Test cricket, the first few batsman who are selected are usually the ones with better defending ability.
            </p><br><br></div>
        
        <div id="bowling">
          <h2>Bowling</h2><br>
              <img src="images/bowling.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
              <p>
                Bowling in cricket refers to when a player - 'the bowler' - propels the ball towards the stumps that a batsman is defending. 
                In terms of objectives, bowlers aim to either take wickets (the act of dismissing batsmen by hitting the stumps with the ball) 
                or to prevent run scoring opportunities. As such, cricketers who can both bowl and bat well are highly regarded and are known 
                as 'all-rounders'.
                <br>
                Each bowl is known as a 'delivery' and bowlers attempt deliveries in sets of six, which makes up an 'over'. When a player has 
                completed their over, a new bowler replaces the player and bowls their set of six balls from the opposite end of the pitch.In 
                limited overs one-day cricket such as the popular 20, 40, and 50 overs versions, a bowler is limited to only 20% of the total 
                overs. However, in first class or Test match cricket, which is the longest form of the sport lasting up to five days, no such 
                bowling limits exist but the rule, which states that a bowler cannot bowl consecutive overs, still applies.<br>
                
                In cricket, bowling a ball well requires great skill and technique as it requires a specific biomechanical action, where the 
                elbow joint of the throwing arm must not straighten out more than 15 degrees during the bowling action. Bowlers are required 
                to hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint, releasing the ball near the top of 
                the arc.<br><br>

            <h2>Fielding</h2><br>
            <img src="images/Fielding.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
            <p>
                Fielding is one of several roles that cricket players will have to take up during a game and this is usually done when their 
                team is bowling to the opposition.Fielding refers to the act of catching, collecting and returning a ball that has been hit by 
                the batsman. There are nine fielders on each team, as one player out of the 11 will have to act as the bowler, while another 
                takes up the role of the wicket keeper.<br>

                The main aim of a fielder is twofold. One of the fielder's roles is to minimise or stop the runs of the opposition batsmen. 
                This is best done by gathering the ball after it has been hit, and returning the ball to the wicket keeper as quickly as 
                possible, so as to prevent runs from being scored.<br>

                At the same time, each fielder is always looking to retire or dismiss a batsman by either catching the ball in mid-air in the 
                field of play - after it's been hit and before the ball touches the ground or by running the batsman out by throwing the ball 
                to either set of stumps causing the bails to fall. When a fielder successfully executes either of these, then the batsman scores 
                no runs.In terms of fielder positions, there are a variety of roles and names to be aware of. For example, there is a slip, 
                gully, point, third man, fine leg, square leg, mid wicket, mid on, mid off, long off and long on. While these are the main and 
                most common fielder positions, there are many more positions that can be used in a match.
            </p>
            <img src="images/SSCGraphic01FieldV22.jpg" width="850" height="350" alt=""><br>
            <p>
                The positions of the fielders can be easily determined as they are usually named after the angle and distance relative to the 
                batsman, such as mid off, which refers to a middle distance to the off side (right side) of the direction that the batsman is 
                facing.<br>

                In cricket, the most important fielder positions are the slip and point fielder, as they are located in prime locations to catch 
                the ball. For instance, the slip is placed on the right side of the right-handed batsman, and is usually the best form of defence 
                for the fielding team as they are the in best position to catch any balls that is out of reach of the wicket keeper.As a result, 
                there can be more than one slip in the game. Besides the slips, the point fielders are also crucial, as they are in the best 
                position to receive and catch powerful shots. Backward point and silly points are both also variants of the point fielder.<br>

                Fielders are allowed to be anywhere on the field, except when the ball is being batted. In that instance, the fielders are 
                forbidden from being over the wicket, and no part of his body is allowed to be in contact with the wicket.

                <h2>Run</h2><br>

                <p>
                    In order to score a run, both batsmen have to run towards the opposite end and touch their bat on the crease. This 
                    constitutes a single run. According to the Laws of Cricket, the simplest way for a batsman to score is by completing a 
                    run after a ball has been hit or a misthrow by the bowler or fielder occurs giving the batsmen an opportunity to rack up 
                    a run.<br>
                    While there are no set amount of runs that can be completed, batsmen usually only continue running to and fro the popping 
                    creases until they are forced to stop by the fielding team or when the ball goes over the boundary.If the ball goes over 
                    the boundary, then the batting team is automatically awarded four runs and if the ball leaves the boundary without first 
                    touching the field of play then six runs are awarded instead. Alternatively, both batsmen can choose not to run, if either 
                    or both of them deem the chances of completing a run to be low.<br>
                    The proper way to execute a run is for the batsman to run from one popping crease to the other popping crease, with the 
                    other non-striking batsman running from the opposite crease. In order for the run to be registered, both batsmen have to 
                    put any part of their body or bat behind the line of the popping crease.<br>

                    They will both have to run the length of the wicket simultaneously, crossing each other in the process and making sure that 
                    the fielding team does not catch them out. This situation happens when a batsman falls short of the popping crease when the 
                    bails of a stump are knocked off after being struck by the ball.The runs carried out by the batsman will be added to the 
                    individual's score, as well as the team's score. However, if a run is awarded for extras such as no ball, the run is awarded 
                    only to the team score.<br>
                    Runs are usually scored in even numbers, but odd number of runs are also possible. If an odd number of runs is scored, it 
                    means that the roles of both batsmen are reversed, and the non-striking batsman will be the next to bat.In terms of 
                    milestones, a batsman scoring half a century (50 runs) or a century, hundred or ton (100 runs) are regarded as a significant 
                    achievement. As such, a partnership between two batsmen that adds to the aggregate team score in multiples of 50 runs is also 
                    deserves special applause. However, should a batsman be dismissed before being able to score a single run, then they would 
                    have deemed to have recorded a 'duck' or 'duck's egg' and suffer the indignity of this failure.

                    <p>
                    Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced the 
                    lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as "that's not cricket" (that's unfair), "had a good 
                    innings" (lived a long life) and "sticky wicket". "On a sticky wicket" (aka "sticky dog" or "glue pot") is a metaphor used to 
                    describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.

                    Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron. Beyond a Boundary (1963), written 
                    by Trinidadian C. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written.<br>

                    Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called 
                    "possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century." French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on 
                    a visit to England in the 1890s. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batter in motion. Caribbean artist Wendy
                    Nanan's cricket images are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's "World of Invention" stamp issue, 
                    which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1-3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the 
                    celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

                <h2>Influence on other sports</h2><br>
                <p>Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.
                    In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with "a code of laws" to keep 
                    cricketers fit during the off-season. The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members
                    codified the first laws of the game. It is typically played on modified cricket fields.<br>
                    
                    football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months. 
                    Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884; Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were 
                    both founded by members of church cricket teams. Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the 
                    Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield 
                    United from 1889 to 1973.<br>

                    In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the 
                    baseball box score (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 
                    1859 issue of the Clipper. The statistical record is so central to the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick is sometimes 
                    referred to as "the Father of Baseball" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.
